                    <p>VR GROUP was founded by <strong>Mr. Ramshibhai Goriya</strong> in 2016, which is now a well-recognized group in Gujarat. It started business operations in 2015 as a Civil Work & Earth Moving service provider with owned & hired fleet of vehicles. We recently completed a significant 90 MW project of wind farm under KP Green Energy Pvt. Ltd.</p>
                    
                    <p>During our forward journey, we have virtually surpassed all expectations in renewable (Solar, Wind & Hybrid) power sectors over the last more than 9+ years. The Company has completed more than 3+ years of successful operations, all contributing to the fast and robust growth of the group.</p>
                    
                    <p>In a short time period, the company has achieved phenomenal growth as a result of diversification into fabrication and galvanizing, renewable energy sector (Solar, Wind & Hybrid). VRECO ENERGY has been significantly contributing to India's green energy transition. Our commitment towards green energy transition has become even stronger.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Company has successfully started Initial Public Offer in both Solar and Wind renewable energy. In the upcoming future, we will be listed on BSE Limited and NSE.</p>
